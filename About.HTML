    <h1>This is my "About Page"</h1>
    <p>My name is Trace and I am looking to get more established in the tech industry.</p>
    <p>I have experience working with information tech, customer service, and logistics. I see a lot of potential in the modification of logistical tech applications that help ease customer experience..I hope to learn more about that industry and possibly get started in it.</p>
    <p>I love soul and latin american foods. However, I have been trying to be more health conscious lately, so I really try to do meals that are well balanced with nutritional benefits.</p>
